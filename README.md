# Nessus-Vulnerability-Scanner-on-Metasploitable2

## Objective
The objective of a project using the Nessus Vulnerability Scanner on Metasploitable2 is typically to identify and assess security vulnerabilities in a controlled, vulnerable environment (Metasploitable2) using Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanner.This project can be a stepping stone in ethical hacking and vulnerability management practice.

### Skills Learned
-Vulnerability Identification: Scan the Metasploitable2 virtual machine for security vulnerabilities, including outdated software, configuration issues, open ports, and exploitable services
-Risk Assessment: Analyze the severity of vulnerabilities based on the Nessus report, classifying them as low, medium, or high-risk, and assess the potential impact.
-Understanding Exploits: Used the results from Nessus to explore potential exploits that could be launched against Metasploitable2, helping you understand how attackers might leverage vulnerabilities.
-Hands-on Practice: Gain practical experience using Nessus, interpreting scan results, and understanding real-world vulnerabilities in a safe, ethical environment.
-Remediation Planning: Based on the identified vulnerabilities, develop strategies for patching and securing the system to minimize the attack surface.

### Tools Used
-Kali Linux: A Linux distribution designed for penetration testing and security research, equipped with numerous ethical hacking tools.
-Nessus: A comprehensive vulnerability scanner used to detect security flaws, misconfigurations, and potential exploits in systems and networks.
-Metasploitable2: A deliberately vulnerable virtual machine used for learning and practicing penetration testing and ethical hacking techniques.

### Steps
-power on kali linux 
-open terminal and type this command to start Nessus
